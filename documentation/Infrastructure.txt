For AWS deployment the following was used:

EBS -> elascticbeanstalk to host the backend
       the build file only was deployed , we needed node version 14.15

S3  -> bucket to host frontend project 
       the build file only was deployed , it contains html , css and javascript
       that's why we choose static web hosting

RDS -> relational database
       to persist our data
