The pipeline (circleci + Github)

th deployment contains 3 steps :
1- build
   for frontend and backend projects
   we install dependencies , build the project and persist the file resulting from the build 
   so that it will be used for the deploy step
   
2- manual approval
   the code will not be deployed unless approved manually 

3- deployment
   for both backend and frontend
   only the build folders will be deployed
